In addition to your preferred billing option, you'll also pay for things like data storage (including backups), data transfer costs (either to external clouds/services or different AWS regions), replication to global tables, the number of DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) nodes you have provisioned, read/write operations for DyanmoDB Streams, and any reserved capacity you want to maintain for long term workloads.\"},\n",
